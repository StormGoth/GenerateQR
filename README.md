# GenerateQR
A small Go programm to generate QR-codes from CSV. I'll extend it to be configurable when I'm in the mood.

Curently Everything is hardcoded, every line in the input.csv is one QR code, the semicolons will be replaced by linebreaks, the part after 'Serien: ' to the firstsemicolon will be the filename...
